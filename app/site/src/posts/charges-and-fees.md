We charge a flat fee of **0.095%** for each successful flash loan.

For example of a flash loan of 1,000 USDC, you will need to repay 1,000.95 USDC.  In this case the total amount of interest charged would be 0.95 USDC.

Where does this amount go?  Good question!  This amount is automatically deposited into the USDC flash loan pool.  For loans that use other currencies such as SOL or BONK, it would be deposited into the SOL or BONK flash loan pools respectively.

What happens next?  Whenever a person who deposited into a flash loan pool withdraws their funds, they also withdraw their share of the flash loan fees that have been collected.  This means that the flash loan fees charged are distributed to the depositors.
