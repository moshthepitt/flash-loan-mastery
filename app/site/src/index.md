**Flash Loan Mastery** is a smart contract that enables flash loans on Solana.  We think that this is the simplest and best Solana flash loan program.

## Why does Flash Loan Mastery exist?

- Solana currently does not have an independent flash loan offering and we think that it is important that it does so.  Flash Loan Mastery is completely independent and open source.
- Current flash loan offerings in Solana are tied to borrow/lend platforms and all too often borrowing is disabled right when direly needed like during turbulent markets.  Flash Loan Mastery cannot be disabled by anyone for any reason.

## Our approach

Our aim is to make Flash Loan Mastery as simple as possible, with very easy to understand code.  Unlike most Solana smart contracts, Flash Loan Mastery is completely open source and we aim to freeze the smart contract (make it un-upgradeable) within the next 3 months (of January 2023).

## What can it be used for?

- **Arbitrage**: traders might earn by spotting price discrepancies across several different exchanges and exploiting them. [Read more](/posts/jupiter-arbitrage-trading/)
- **Collateral swaps**: quickly replace another type of collateral for the collateral used to secure the user's loan
- **Interest rate swaps**: quickly move from one lending platform to another in search of better interest rates

## How much does it cost?

We charge a flat fee of **0.095%** for each successful flash loan.  [Read more](/posts/charges-and-fees/).
